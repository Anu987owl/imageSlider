# imageSlider(Virtual Gallery)

This project is a dynamic, fully functional Interactive Image Slider designed to display a gallery of images with various navigation controls. It offers a clean, modern interface and smooth transitions, making it suitable for showcasing photography, product images, or artwork.

Key Features ----------------
The slider is engineered for both automated viewing and complete user control. The main features include Automatic Slideshow functionality, which rotates through the images every three seconds. Users have Manual Navigation control through prominent previous and next buttons. The Play/Pause Toggle allows users to stop the automatic slideshow to focus on a particular image and resume it when ready. Visual Indicators (dots at the bottom) show the user their current position in the gallery and allow for direct, one-click navigation to any image. The slider features a responsive design and smooth CSS-based transitions, ensuring a seamless visual experience across all screen sizes.
